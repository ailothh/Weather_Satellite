This project is focused on the collection and analysis of atmospheric data from weather satellites. It involves gathering data, processing it for analysis, and potentially using it for weather prediction and planning. The repository will contain scripts and documents that facilitate the extraction, transformation, and analysis of satellite data, with a particular focus on atmospheric conditions.
