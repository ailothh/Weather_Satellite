This project is focused on the collection and analysis of atmospheric data from weather satellites. It involves gathering data from openweather API and using it for weather prediction and planning. The repository will contain scripts and documents that facilitate the extraction, transformation, and analysis of satellite data, with a particular focus on atmospheric conditions. 

This project was a collaborative effort with three classmates, focused on building a weather satellite data collection and analysis interface. The main objective was not only to develop technical skills but also to experience starting a project from the very beginningâ€”defining requirements, setting timelines, and working as a team to bring the project to life. We worked together to set clear project goals, assign tasks, and ensure effective communication throughout the development process.

**Key Objectives:**
Teamwork and Collaboration: Throughout the project, we emphasized teamwork and collaboration, ensuring that each team member contributed their unique skills and expertise. Effective communication and problem-solving were at the heart of our success.

**Starting from Scratch:** We started with a basic idea and worked through the phases of development, from gathering data requirements to creating the user interface. This experience taught us how to break down a project into manageable parts and tackle it step by step.

**Setting Requirements and Timelines:** At the outset, we carefully defined clear project requirements and set realistic timelines for each phase. This helped us stay organized, ensure we met our milestones, and deliver a working product on time.

****Learning and Applying Skills:** This project allowed us to apply a range of programming skills such as getting started working with API's. We used Tkinter to display the GUI to the user.
